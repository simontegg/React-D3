Experimental proof-of-concept interface for a budget allocation UI.


```
git clone git@github.com:simontegg/React-D3.git
cd React-D3
npm install
npm run develop

```

Demonstrates interaction-context based shape-tweening. 

Maintains a consistent data model by using React's ```.setState()``` for animations with D3 methods as helpers.
